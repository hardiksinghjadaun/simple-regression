project: PREDICTIVE MODELING WITH LINEAR REGRESSION
[Screenshot 2024-07-21 120544](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/162955d9-69bc-40ee-9ee9-fba15eaf266a)

objective:

Implement a simple linear regression model using a dataset with continuous
target variables. Split the data into training and testing sets, train the model on
the training data, evaluate its performance using metrics like mean squared
error or R-squared, and make predictions on the test set. Visualize the
regression line and actual vs. predicted values to assess the model's accuracy.

key activities:

Key activities for simple regression in projects typically include the following:

1. **Data Collection:** Gathering relevant data that will be used to perform the regression analysis.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis, which may involve handling missing values, outliers, and scaling features.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducting an initial exploration of the data to understand its characteristics and relationships between variables.

4. **Model Selection:** Choosing a suitable regression model for the project based on the nature of the data and problem at hand.
